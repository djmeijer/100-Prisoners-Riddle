# 100 Prisoners Riddle

- After seeing this item on Veritasium's channel: [The Riddle That Seems Impossible Even If You Know The Answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA).
- The actual theoritical probability never get's worse than 1 - ln 2 â‰ˆ 30,7% for any number of prisoners where intuition might point to extremely small, near zero probability.
- When the first prisoner is allowed to do an exchange of slips between two boxes and the right strategy is choosen, the survival rate is 100%! ðŸ¤¯

I did a test run with:
- 3 group strategies
    1. Cheating strategy. Each prisoner opens all boxes for a 100% success rate. This is just a sanity check for the algorithm and can't be used as a solution.
    2. First closed box. Each prisoner just opens the first closed box. This is a random strategy and not successful.
    3. Circle strategy. This is the winning strategy.
- 3 different prisoner group size: 20, 100, 200. This is to test scaling.
- 3 different first prisoner strategies
    1. Don't use the option two exchange slips.
    2. Perform a random exchange.
    3. Break longest circle in two. This is the winning first prisoner strategy.
- Repeat each of the above combinations 20.000 times.
